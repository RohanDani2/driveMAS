# HackHarvard-2018
Project Name: driveMAS

Our objective was to create an interactive way to bring the driving community together by recieving awards for driving energy efficiently and show those driving gas powered vehicles the advantages of driving an EV car. We focused on applying stats from specifically Massachusetts and see how much can be possibly saved. They are able to compete with one another by generating more coins by reducing their carbon footprint with an EV car and to show the people with gas powered vehicles the power of EV vehicles and what effect each person could have!
