								<h3>September 2018 - December 2018: LoyaltyOne.</h3>
								<p> My second co-op has been an absolute blast - from managing different real-world data projects with clients in the retail sector to advancing my SQL skills in executing these data projects, I was able to develop and model different strategies/solutions using millions of rows of data from constant model refreshes. I designed different implementation strategies myself! Plus, the meetings we had with teams working more directly with clients were valuable and nothing less of a privilege. </p>

								<h3>January 2018 - April 2018: BlackBerry Messenger.</h3>
								<p> My first co-op term was a special one, one full of hard work, realization and discovery. From having full control of the Sticker Store and its weekly releases of Stickers and Banners to the data platform I developed using Tableau and the design thinking presentation I gave to my managers and VPs, I explored a vast range of tasks and domains, all while staying focused on daily tasks and priorities. BlackBerry Messenger paved the way for my discovery of more advanced technology!</p>

								<h3> May 2017 - Dec 2017: Qidni Labs, Inc. </h3>
								<p> Situated at a University - affiliated incubator called Velocity, this introduction of start-up culture and experience is definitely memorable. The Founder and CEO at Qidni provided me two projects: one involving blood research and the other more business-oriented. I continued my work even into the fall term, while I attended classes at Waterloo. </p>

								<h3>Explore Weather Trends Project with Udacity.</h3>
								<p> Using SQL to extract and convert data, I later integrated Tableau with my CSV file findings to visualize graphs in order to compare temperatures among different cities, as part of an investigation to find which cities have suffered from global warming the most. This definitely was my first introductory project to SQL and opened the doors for many more to come!</p>

								<h3>Participating in my first ever Hackathon at York University!</h3>
								<p> Who knew I would finally be able to tackle a long-time fear! Not only that, but our team worked on a platform to help predict refugee migration patterns with a little bit of machine learning! We ended up winning a Wolfram Alpha Reward for being within the Top 15 out of 100 projects submitted! </p>

								<h3>My BBM Sticker Prediction Tool Produced with Python.</h3>

								<h3>Participating in various Digital Product Camps with Deloitte and IBM.</h3>

								<h3>A Lead Consultant for Various University Clubs and Groups at Watsolve Consulting Group!</h3>
								<p> As someone who was a Finance Consultant and now a Lead Consultant, I helped provide suggestions for funding and financial tracking for both external and internal, while working both on campus and remotely during co-op. This included attending weekly meetings, emailing and meeting with clients to tackle business problems for a sustainable and strategic future, and developing a template to track finances internally. </p>

								<h3>Although my stamina definitely needs some work, my favourite sport is soccer!</h3>
								<p> I compete in intramurals or club seasons on a yearly basis. Other hobbies I have include playing volleyball, dodgeball, weightlifting, playing with my dog, playing baord games and playing video games!</p>
